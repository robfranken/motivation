# Background

Social network partners may motivate your sport behavior through a variety of mechanisms. I have devoted some extra attention to the measurement of motivation, as this remains a stumbling block in previous research (mainly due to the multidimensionality of the construct). A person-centered approach towards measuring motivation has gained a lot of popularity.

In the following, I will go through and apply Latent Profile Analysis. Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) tries to identify clusters of individuals (i.e., latent profiles) based on responses to a series of continuous variables (i.e., indicators). LPA assumes that there are unobserved latent profiles that generate patterns of responses on indicator items.   

I will go through an example of LPA to identify groups of athletes based on their motivations to take part in running. The data comes from the [ABS](https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/ui/datasets/id/easy-dataset:189895) panel study.     

Terminology note: terms like *clusters*, *profiles*, *classes*, and *groups* are used interchangeably, but are slightly different. In this example we'll stick to profiles to refer to a grouping of cases, following LPA terminology.

LPA is a Finite Mixture Model (FMM) [(see here)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/130805/are-there-any-non-distance-based-clustering-algorithms/130810#130810). FMM is different from other clustering algorithms in that it offers a "model-based clustering", deriving profiles [*top-down*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design) using a probablistic model that describes the distribution of the data (compared to a *bottom-up* approach in which clusters are derived using an arbitrary chosen distance measure).
